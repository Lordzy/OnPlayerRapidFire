	"OPRF" AKA OnPlayerRapidFire is a simple include which provides a callback
	called "OnPlayerRapidFire" which is called when a player does rapid shots.
	Rapid shots can be harmful for DM servers which are on 0.3z versions as it
	could kill a player in less than a second. This include determines and is
	able to prevent damage caused from rapid shots!
